This is a placeholder for the abstract background image.

For the actual site, you should replace this with a real image file named "abstract-bg.jpg" in this directory.

The image should be:
1. An abstract or geometric pattern
2. Dark-themed (dark blues, purples, etc.)
3. High resolution (at least 1920x1080)
4. Large enough to cover the entire page background
